# Session Recap – 2025-06-26

This file collates the key decisions, code edits, and remaining tasks captured during the multi-day ChatGPT session so the work can resume seamlessly in a new thread.

## 1  Major Changes Implemented

### 1.1  Vendorised visual helpers (`hb_components`) ✅
* Candlestick & price traces
* Trade overlay, signal markers (size-scaled)
* Cumulative PnL trace
* Backtesting figure builder (3-row: price / signals / PnL)
* KPI metric cards
* Theme palette + dark layout

### 1.2  Streamlit Pages
| Page | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Experiments Overview** (`2_Experiments_Overview.py`) | Batch KPI header, Ag-Grid leaderboard, real run preview | Implemented ✔ |
| **Top 5** (`3_Top_5.py`) | Ranks CSV by KPI & expandable quick profiles | Implemented ✔ |
| **Experiment Analysis** (`5_Experiment_Analysis.py`) | Any run deep-dive with KPI + 3-row chart + executor table | Implemented ✔ |

### 1.3  Sweeps
* All market-making sweeps now use single ±2 % spread layer.
* `batch_tester.py` & `multi_market_sweep_tester.py` write full JSON packets to `results/detail_packets/`.

### 1.4  Logging / Dev Watch
* `dashboard/app_logging.py` sets rotating log `logs/dashboard_runtime.log`.
* `scripts/dev_watch.py` runs Streamlit (`dashboard/app.py`) with auto-reload and tails the log so errors appear in terminal.

### 1.5  Dependencies
* Added `pandas-ta` and `streamlit-aggrid` to `environment.yml` (also pip-installed).

## 2  Roadmap (see `docs/analyst_funnel_plan.md`)

Milestone IDs left open:
| ID | Deliverable | State |
|----|-------------|-------|
| **M5-c** | Complete Trade-Inspector polish (colour-coded trade table, win/loss calc) | TODO |
| **M5-d** | Theme consolidation & optional extras (performance timeline, DCA tab) | TODO |

---
## 3  Outstanding Issues / Ideas
1. Improve scaling of signal marker sizes (currently linear `size/1000`).
2. Global dark theme override in `.streamlit/config.toml` for consistent colours.
3. Add performance-over-time subplot (`performance_time_evolution.py`).
4. DCA analysis page using `performance_dca.py` widgets (only for relevant runs).
5. Unit tests for DataFrame loaders & helper modules.
